<h2>
    Does recycling do more harm than good?
</h2>
<br>
     <p>
        Recycling is hands down, without a doubt, better for the environment than sending waste to landfill. But don’t just take my word for it.
</p>
<p>
        Aside from best practice of not burying our trash in the ground, a recent study looked at the amount of energy it takes to manufacture 
        products from recyclables versus virgin materials, including the energy used for collecting, hauling and processing the recyclables. 
        Turns out, virgin material manufacturing requires nearly double the energy (23.3 million Btu) than recycled material manufacturing
         (10.4 million Btu), even when you include the 0.9 million Btu for collecting, hauling and processing the recyclables.
    </p>


<h2>
    What happens when you put everything into one recycling bin?
</h2>
<p>
    Back in the day, you might recall having to sort your glass, plastic, paper, and aluminum into different bins for pickup. That’s no longer 
    necessary in many towns and cities across the U.S. Single-stream recycling (SSR) is the result of new technology that sorts recyclables all
    at one facility, using magnets, electric currents, and even lasers.
</p>

<h2>
    Are plastic bags recyclable?
</h2>
<p>
    I can understand why this one is confusing, because yes, plastic bags are recyclable – but no, not in most curbside or single-stream 
    recycling (SSR) programs. Just because an item is “recyclable”, doesn’t mean it’s accepted by your local facility. Be sure to look at the
    labels on your bins to get some further clarification on what can/can not be accepted.
Because plastic bags are made of a thin plastic film, they get caught in the sorting technology and/or shredding machinery at most recycling 
facilities.</p>

 <p>
Don’t put them in your regular recycling bin (unless told otherwise by your recycling provider).
Instead, you have two options: 1) opt for BYOB (bring your own bags) and reduce your consumption of single-use plastic bags, or 2) recycle them 
the proper way by taking them to designated bag recycling kiosks or collection sites. Many grocery stores – including Wegmans, Whole Foods, and
 even Target – provide plastic bag recycling bins inside their stores.

<h2>
    Can aluminum foil be recycled?
</h2>
<p>
    Aluminum foil is similar to the plastic bag conundrum. Technically, because it is aluminum, it is recyclable – but not all recycling 
    facilities will accept it. Check this Recycling Locator to see the requirements in your area.
</p>
<p>
Two common reasons why facilities won’t accept foil are that it’s either too soiled with food or too thin/soft for their equipment to safely
 process it. If you can’t recycle foil in your area, consider switching to reusable containers or food covers, or wipe down and reuse your foil
instead of tossing it.
</p>

<h2>
    Is glass recyclable?
</h2>
<p>
    Glass is infinitely recyclable, but (and there’s always a “but”)…it may not be accepted in your curbside recycling or SSR. In recent years, 
    recycling facilities have been turning away glass due to its breakability both in transit and in processing. 
</p>
    
<p>
    Broken glass can be costly to collect and sort safely, so check with your local recycling requirements before placing it in your curbside
    bin. The good news is, glass makes for great reusable containers and many retailers and local deposit sites still collect glass,
     even if your curbside pickup does not.
</p>

<h2>
    How does recycling save energy?
</h2>
<p>
    When we make new products out of virgin materials, we expend energy to extract and process those materials. This includes burning fossil 
    fuels. However, if we manufacture products using recycled materials, we reduce the need for virgin materials and save the energy required to
    extract and process them.
</p>

<p>
To estimate how much energy you can save by recycling certain products, EPA has developed a tool called the individual Waste Reduction Model
(iWARM). This tool calculates how much energy you save by recycling aluminum cans, glass or plastic bottles, magazines or plastic grocery bags,
shows you how long those savings could power different electrical appliances.
