         My name is Joshua Ibirogba,  i am a final year computer systems technology student. I am founding this enivronmental startup, with my friends
         Kelvin Igwe, David Wokoma, Abdul Omope and Stephen Omitoki. 
     </p>

     <p>
        The vision of this startup is to use technology to solve the climate change crisis currently being experienced around the globe. 
        Statistics has shown that earth's temperature has risen by 0.14 fahrenheit per decade since 1880. The year 2020 was the second-warmest 
        year on record based on NOAA's temperature data, and land areas were record warm.
        
        The plastic industry will be the main focus of our startup, reliable data from the World Bank shows the aforementioned industry accounts
        for 6 percentage of global oil consumption and it is on course to reach 20 percentage by 2050.
        DePlast aims to reduce plastic waste by connecting recycling companies with consumers, our platform will give users the oppotunity
        to know the value of their plastic bottles before heading to the depots to sell them for recycling. 
     </p>
        
     <p>
        How can customers recycle their plastic bottles?

        Customers bring their plastic bottles to any of our Bottle Depots where we pay a Full Deposit.
        We sort the plastic bottles manually into bags by type.
        We then ship them to a plastic reprocessing plant where they begin the recycling process.
        An intense wash process cleans the bottles, removing labels & contaminates.
        Once the cleaning is complete, the bottles go through a process that shreds the plastic into tiny pieces. They heat the plastic pieces and then press them into tiny pellets.
        Finally, manufacturers use the plastic pellets to make new products like bottles, liquid containers, packaging and more.        
     </p>
     <p>
        When it comes to embracing environmentally friendly technologies, recycling may not be as exciting as solar panels or hybrid cars, but it’s one area where consumers can make a huge difference.

        Plastics Baling Through municipal recycling programs, specific types of post-consumer plastics are collected, processed for recycling, and used to create an array of second-generation products – everything from fleece jackets and bottles for beverages and detergents to carpeting and even high-end composite lumber for outdoor decking.
        
        Collection is only the first part of recycling, the recycling symbol has three arrows that represent three parts. Collection, remanufacture, and resale. So to continue past the first phase we need end markets with a demand for feedstock to produce recycled content and markets for those end products.
